# Google Minesweeper Bot

A Python bot that automatically plays the Google Minesweeper game using screen automation.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer
The pixel colors and screen coordinates are **hardcoded**, so this bot may not work out of the box on all systems or screen resolutions. If it doesn't behave as expected, you'll likely need to tweak some values in `main.py`.

# ✅ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7 or higher).
2. Install the required packages:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the bot:

    `python main.py`
